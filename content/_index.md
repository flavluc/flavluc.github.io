Hi there! So I've spent quite a bit to get motivation and set this up, but finally, it's here. In this place I plan to give a short presentation about myself, so if you're reading this, you're probably thinking about hiring me, in this case, you should definitely check out my [portfolio](@/portfolio/index.md), otherwise, you're just stalking around, then maybe you'd like to read some some fun stuff at my [personal blog](@/blog/_index.md).

Unfortunately, I'm too lazy to keep a bilingual webpage - sorry brazilian folks =( - so most of the content here will be in English, but there might be some in Portuguese as well.

As of writing this post, I'm 20 yo and currently in the third year of my Computer Science course at [UFMG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Minas_Gerais). Also, I work as an undergraduate research assistant at the [Compilers Lab](http://lac.dcc.ufmg.br/) with some other colleagues and professors such as [Fernando](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~fernando/) and [Haniel](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~hbarbosa/). My main interests are related to Programming Languages, Functional Programming and Compilers, so you're probably guessing, and you're right, that I like to code mostly in Rust and Haskell, although most of the time I work with Python, JS and C++, however, I have hope that someday I'll be able to say that I'm actually working with my favorite languages.

Besides programming, maybe it's worth mentioning that I'm an INTJ, liberal, and I usually spend my spare time with things like learning new languages (currently I'm learning Japanese), watching anime (maybe you'd like to check me out on [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io/explore/anime)), reading random stuff and doing uncommon-but-fun things.

For now, I'm just an aspiring student, so probably there's no cool enough project worth showing here. That means that we're getting to an end =(. If you care about it, you can find my on Telegram by [@flavluc](https://t.me/flavluc), I love to chat around about random things, so hit me up anytime.

If you've read this until the end I just want to let you know that you're amazing! I hope you're having a great day, take care, stay safe and keep hydrated. If you're having a tough day, please take a break, treat yourself to something nice and remember that Koharu will be always here, in the right-bottom corner of the page, for you =)
