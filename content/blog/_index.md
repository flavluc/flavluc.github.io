So you've made it! Here's a place where I'll be writing about some things I think it's fun. First of all, I have to say that this is not supposed to be any source material for learning purposes. I'm not a specialist in anything yet, so all of the posts in this page are based on my interpretation and experience with the specific topic I'll be writing about. That being said, let me now show some of the reason I'm writing this blog for.

The first and the most important one is that writing (or typing) is really fun. I really enjoy writing about anything even if it won't be useful in the future. Just the process of elaborating a text syntactically and semantically seems to be something quite rewarding to me. Maybe that's why I like coding. The other reason is: self learning. You probably must've heard somewhere that teaching someone about something is in fact a good way to learn. And last but not least, I've recently watched a really interesting [video](https://youtu.be/Ja6ZnJUQa_0) which triggered me to start this blog.

This is my initial list of posts. I hope you enjoy the reading ^.^
