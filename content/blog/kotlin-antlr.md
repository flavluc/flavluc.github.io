title = "An arithmetic expressions evaluator with Kotlin and ANTLR4"
description = "I've recently been working with Kotlin and ANTLR4 in my IC project and one of the tasks I had to do is writing a parser using these two technologies. I didn't found much information online besides the ANTLR book and documentation. So, after reading them, I decided to make a short tutorial to make things easier for me and my colleagues."

In this post I'll be showing how to write a arithmetic expression evaluator using ANTLR4 as a parser generator and a visitor interface written in Kotlin to walk on the generated tree. I didn't use any build tool for this tutorial because it was supposed to be quite simple, but I intend to improve it later and show how things can be done using [gradle](https://gradle.org/).

## 1 - Install Kotlin
Follow the instructions at the [Kotlin installation guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html).

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.6" 2020-01-14
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.6+10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.6+10, mixed mode)

$ kotlin -version
Kotlin version 1.3.72-release-468 (JRE 11.0.6+10)

$ kotlinc -version
info: kotlinc-jvm 1.3.72 (JRE 11.0.6+10)
```


## 2 - Install ANTLR4

Follow the instructions at the [ANTLR website](https://www.antlr.org).

By now you should have the `antlr4` alias configured as described.

```
$ antlr4
ANTLR Parser Generator  Version 4.8
...
```

## 3 - Set up a grammar file
After setting up our environment we need to write a grammar for our parser.
```
/** ./Expr.g4 */

/** Grammars always start with a grammar header (which must have the same name of the file). */
grammar Expr;

/** A rule called `prog` which will be our entry point
 *  This rule means that a program is a sequence of one or more `stat`s 
 */
prog:   stat+ ;

/** A `stat` rule may be each of the four alternatives (represented by `|`)
 *  The `#` in front of each alternative is a label, we need it so ANTLR generates a visitor function for each alternative (else it would generate one for the whole rule)
 */
stat:   ID '=' expr NEWLINE         # assign
    |   CLEAR NEWLINE               # clear
    |   expr NEWLINE                # printExpr
    |   NEWLINE                     # blank
    ;

/** The `expr` rule to recognize arithmetic expressions */
expr:   expr op=('*'|'/') expr      # MulDiv
    |   expr op=('+'|'-') expr      # AddSub
    |   INT                         # int
    |   ID                          # id
    |   '(' expr ')'                # parens
    ;

/** We also need to define some token names for the operator literals.
 *  That way we can reference token names as Java/Kotlin constants in the visitor.
 *  The same applies for the `op=` in the `expr` rule
 */
MUL :   '*' ;            // assigns token name to '*' used above in grammar
DIV :   '/' ;
ADD :   '+' ;
SUB :   '-' ;
CLEAR:  'clear' ;        // match clear keyword
ID  :   [a-zA-Z]+ ;      // match identifiers
INT :   [0-9]+ ;         // match integers
NEWLINE:'\r'? '\n' ;     // return newlines to parser (is end-statement signal)
WS  :   [ \t]+ -> skip ; // toss out whitespace
```

## 4 - Tree walker
By using ANTLR we have basically three easy ways of interacting with the parsing tree generated by the parser:
 - Listeners
   - ANTLR generates a Listener interface
   - Can create listener functions for each grammar rule
   - There's no need explicitly walk down the tree (ANTLR does it automatically)

 - Visitors:
   - ANTLR generates an interface for the well-known Visitor pattern
   - Can create visitor functions for each grammar rule or alternative
   - You have to explicitly walk down the tree by calling `visit()` on the children nodes
 
 - Actions and Semantic Predicates
   - Can embed arbitrary code within expression grammar.
   - Can compute values or print things on-the-fly during the parsing (no need of a parsing tree).
   - Influence on how the parser recognizes input phrases.
   - Based on runtime information decide which rule to apply.

You can find more information about each of these in the [ANTLR documentation](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/index.md). Here I'll keep with the visitor pattern.

```
// ./eval-visitor.kt

/** ExprBaseVisitor is the base class generated by ANTLR */
class EvalVisitor() : ExprBaseVisitor<Int>() {
  var memory: HashMap<String, Int> = HashMap<String, Int>()

/** These are the functions generated by each label as we defined in our grammar.
 *  Whe only need to override the functions we are interested in.
 */
  override fun visitAssign(ctx: ExprParser.AssignContext ): Int {
      val id = ctx.ID().getText()  
      val value = visit(ctx.expr())   
      memory.put(id, value)
      return value
  }

  /** expr NEWLINE */
  override fun visitPrintExpr(ctx: ExprParser.PrintExprContext): Int {
      val value = visit(ctx.expr()) 
      println(value)         
      return 0                          
  }

  /** INT */
  override fun visitInt(ctx: ExprParser.IntContext): Int {
      return ctx.INT().getText().toInt()
  }

  /** ID */
  override fun visitId(ctx: ExprParser.IdContext): Int {
      val id = ctx.ID().getText()
      val value = memory.get(id)

      return if ( value != null ) { value } else { 0 }
  }

  /** expr op=('*'|'/') expr */
  override fun visitMulDiv(ctx: ExprParser.MulDivContext): Int {
      val left = visit(ctx.expr(0))
      val right = visit(ctx.expr(1)) 

      if ( ctx.op.getType() == ExprParser.MUL ) {
        return left * right
      }
      return left / right 
  }

  /** expr op=('+'|'-') expr */
  override fun visitAddSub(ctx: ExprParser.AddSubContext): Int {
      val left = visit(ctx.expr(0))  
      val right = visit(ctx.expr(1)) 

      if ( ctx.op.getType() == ExprParser.ADD ) {
        return left + right
      }
      return left - right 
  }

  /** '(' expr ')' */
  override fun visitParens(ctx: ExprParser.ParensContext): Int {
      return visit(ctx.expr()) 
  }

  /** 'clear' */
  override fun visitClear(ctx: ExprParser.ClearContext): Int {
      memory.clear()
      return 0
  }
}
```

## 5 - Testing
ANTLR comes with a testing tool in the runtime library called TestRig. If you've followed the installation guide you have a `grun` alias to run and play with.

However, we'll write a simple kotlin application to invoke our parser and call our newly created visitor to execute the arithmetic expressions.

The code is pretty straightforward so I didn't put any comments. Basically we're just creating an `InputStream` from a file, if given, or using `stdin`. Then, this stream will be used to feed our lexer and, consequently, be consumed by our parser.

```
// ./calc.kt

package calc

import org.antlr.v4.runtime.*
import org.antlr.v4.runtime.tree.ParseTree

import java.io.FileInputStream
import java.io.InputStream

import ExprLexer
import ExprParser
import EvalVisitor

fun main(args: Array<String>){

  val inputStream = if (args.size > 0) { FileInputStream(args[0]) } else { System.`in` }

  val input = CharStreams.fromStream(inputStream)
  val lexer = ExprLexer(input)
  val tokens = CommonTokenStream(lexer)
  val parser = ExprParser(tokens)
  val tree = parser.prog()   //`prog` is the entry point we defined in our grammar

  val eval = EvalVisitor()
  eval.visit(tree)
} 
```

## 6 - Running
Once we have everything set up, it's quite easy to compile and run our programs. Here's a sequence of commands to achieve it.

 - Generate the Lexer, Parser, and the Visitor interface with ANTLR4:

```
$ antlr4 -no-listener -visitor Expr.g4
```

 - Compile the generated java files:

```
$ javac Expr*.java
```

 - Compile our visitor and main program with `kotlinc`:

```
$ echo $CLASSPATH
.:/usr/local/lib/antlr-4.8-complete.jar:

$ kotlinc calc.kt eval-visitor.kt -cp $CLASSPATH
```

 - For the sake of testing I wrote a small input file (`test.expr`) so we can pass to our program.

```
193
a = 5
b = 6
a+b*2
clear
a+b
```

 - Run the main program with `kotlin`:

```
$ kotlin -cp $CLASSPATH calc.CalcKt test.expr
193
17
0
```

The first line is just a print expression. The second one is an evaluation of the expression `a+b*2` with the previously defined identifiers. And the last is trying to evaluate `a+b` after cleaning the memory, which obviously is wrong as the identifiers are no more defined. For simplicity's sake we just evaluated it to a default value `0` (this behavior can be changed in our visitor).

## 7 - Conclusion

So that's it! Now we have a working (and simple) Arithmetic Expressions Evaluator.

Most of the information presented here is from [The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1934356999/ref=cm_sw_su_dp) with some adaptions for the Kotlin language. It's a really good book and you're more than encouraged to read it.

There are plenty of information in the [Official Documentation](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/index.md) as well, so fell free to use both.

Finally, it's probably worth mentioning that you may find the all of the code used in this tutorial in my [github repository](https://github.com/flavluc/kotlin-antlr).

Hope you've enjoyed xD
